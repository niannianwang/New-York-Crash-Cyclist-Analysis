Question
Original motivation to explore this dataset is because of the post I saw from New York Times on instagram. (link: https://www.instagram.com/p/C4KFCSELMr0/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D) The posts states how e-bikes are having more serious accidents than traditional bikes. 

After reading the post, my immediate question was that I don't think deaths can represent how dangerous it is. I became curious about the overall accidents, as smaller accidents without deaths can also impact people's lives significantly. However, other information was not provided and want to investigate further. I found a relevant data set from NYC OpenData on crash cyclists https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Crash-Cyclist-2020/2kbb-e72t/about_data. When I accessed the dataset, it was updated to March 26, 2024.

For data cleaning, 2024 will not be incorporated as there is no data for the whole year yet.

Deceptive Visualization
Description
As motivated by the New York Times instagram post, discussing e-bikes being more dangerous than traditional bikes. If I would to oppose their argument, I can use this deceptive visualization to look like showing a decrease in traditional bike accidents.

For this visualization, I queried the data to only contain the accidents of traditional bikes.

In this visualization, I inverted the y-axis so that the zero starts at the top, which attempts to obfuscate information. At first glance, we would think the number of crashes for traditional bikes, as ploted with a dark black line with black points, bringing the users attention to the black trend line. Noting that I selected line charts to show the change over the years. No values of the data points were given to assist showing the seemingly "decreasing" number of accidents, while it is actually an increase in accidents for traditional bikes.

I highlighted the area from the trend line to the x-axis in red is to balance and still be honest as opposed to highlighting the area below the black trend line. This is because by convention we highlight the area between the curve to the x-axis.

Earnest Visualization
Description
This is the earnest visualization. I created a stacked bar chart is to align with the type that New York Times created so the form is aligned for easier comparison. 

For this graph, I tested out stacking traditional bike on top of ebike and also the other way around. I realize the trend for ebike is relatively more flat to see the changes in traditional bikes that are stacked above, so I designed the bars for ebikes to be below traditional bikes.

I did not do any modifications to the y-axis, meaning how long the bar can directly represent the quantity of accidents.

By looking all cyclist crashes, with the y-axis being standard and equally scaled, we actually see a growth in accidents for traditional bikes compared to ebikes having less growth in accidents. This is very different from the graph presented by New York Times when they focused on cyclist deaths. My chart clearly conveys how traditional bikes can potentially be more dangerous than ebikes.

To make this chart better, I can label their values for every bar and sub-bars. However, I struggle with making them show at the right place and have all of the values be visible. For example, the value labels for ebikes is in orange on top of the area for traditional bikes which is easily visible; oppossitely, the value labels for traditional bikes in blue is written in blue and placed also on the blue area of the bar, which makes it invisible. I am worried that it will end up to be deceptive so decided to not include.

At the end of the day, no matter if it is the New York Times visualization on cyclist deaths or my visualization on accidents in general, which is more dangerous is still opened up to the viewers beliefs and perspective, or how they perceive as being dangerous.
